      <h3>About Myself.</h3>

      <p>
        Welcome to my profile page. Here you will learn more about me. I am 29
        years old and I have recently started on a new journey in life, No
        actually a few new journeys... Well firstly I just got married this year
        and so far its been great as my wife and I enjoy having our own space
        and spending time together, Speaking of space, I recently bought a house
        as well, in todays market I am happy we have a place of our own. And
        lastly for the most interesting thing, I have decided to actually Study
        again after almost 10 years, I would say it's been long overdue as I
        have always liked creating things but after 2 years of national service
        I didn't feel like I had the confidence to start programming again as I
        felt I have forgotten everything but surprisingly it is all coming back
        to me and I am having so much fun.
